### Introduction

This repository is the first project of the master's degree in AI Engineering with [Profession AI](https://profession.ai), all the credits for the requests and idea go to this team.

ContactEase Solutions aims to simplify the management of phone contacts for its users, developing intuitive and interactive software that optimizes the organization and access to personal information.
Users often find it difficult to manage and organize their phone contacts efficiently. There are few simple and intuitive solutions that allow you to add, edit, delete, view and search contacts in one place, directly from the terminal.
ContactEase Solutions will provide an interactive console application which, thanks to the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, will allow simple and structured contact management. Users will be able to easily save and upload contacts in a file format (e.g. JSON), ensuring efficient and secure data management.

Functionality:
- Adding a Contact: Allow the insertion of new contacts.
- Contacts View: Show all your contacts.
- Editing a Contact: Allow editing details of existing contacts.
- Deleting a Contact: Remove contacts from your address book.
- Search for a Contact: Search for contacts by first name or last name.
- Saving and Loading: Save contacts to a file and load them at startup.

User Interface: 
- The interface will be command line based, offering a main menu with clear options for the various operations, thus ensuring a fluid and accessible user experience even for less experienced users.
- As an extra part for this project, I will implement a GUI solution with a Web Application framework
